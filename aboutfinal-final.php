            <h2>What is NJS Printing Services?</h2>

            <p>
                NJS Printing Services is owned and managed by Nicole Jane G. Sarmiento and and was established on February 18, 2022. The shop is located at 069 Real St. Calatagan Tibang, Virac, Catanduanes. The business was established to make it easier and less time-consuming
                for the residents of the community to travel to another printing shop outside of the barangay. The business began in just simple printing, until the owner brought some additional materials that can add up to business like other type of
                papers (photopapers etc.), laminating machine, and studio lights for rush ID. All of these services are available at the present.
                <br> <br> Printing, scanning, rush ID, photocopying, name-tagging, and laminating are among the services the business provides. Plain paper, photo paper, and special/matte paper can all be printed on. There are many different sizes available
                for photo printing including A4, 5R, 4R, 3R, 2R, wallet size, and cute size. Each page of scanning costs five pesos (from hardcopy to softcopy). Images or ID pictures can also be scanned; for instance, if a customer wants his 1x1 ID to
                become a 2x2 ID picture, the cost of scanning these ID pictures is same to the cost of a rush ID. Name-tagging's prices depends on it's sizes as well as its customized designs.

                <br> <br> In addition, individuals who reside a great distance from the shop's location can simply access their services by sending a service request along with the services they wish to use. Only pick-ups are the option for delivery since
                we are lack of personal vehicle for transportation.

            <h2>History of the Business</h2>
            <p>Since the majority of businesses what the owner see in their barangay are <i>sari-sari stores</i>, vegetable markets, fish markets, <i>ukay-ukay</i>, selling pancit/spaghetti/bihon, and many more, the owner first considered what kind of business
                is not yet in the community before she established this one. She did each step individually until she thought of printing, at which point she started. The owner was praised with the clients' compliments that they won't need to travel to
                other places just to print because they are fortunate to be from this area.
                <br> <br> In addition, the owner want her business to be known outside of their community. She also wanted to let people know how and where her abilities may be used by posting all of the works for clients. This can cut down on the amount
                of time the consumer needs to spend waiting in the store while the item is being produced. People will be able to discover about the services we offer and their costs by using the newly developed website.</p>
